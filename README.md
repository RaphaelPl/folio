## Description of the website

### Purpose (not purpoise)
the idea behind the website in this instance is to provide a building block for a professional portfolio website to showcase a little about myself, my skills and tech stack as well as previous work, potential capstone work and mayne some pictures of my cats.

### Functionality and features
The website is a relatively, barebones in terms of structure which holds true for my original design which was a single landing page/splash page with some elements on the page that show, a brief bio, a list of my technology and my previous work. I preferred to keep the page simple as that fits with my design ethics. As it transitions to a mobile version the site stacks the elements progressively. 

### Sitemap
Again relatively simple regarding the page at present. 

Site landing ===> home page

if tablet or mobile ===> scroll elements to read descriptions of cards

### Target Audience 
This sit is intended at this stage for the educators and would be used as a base for build on for potential employers. As it stands I would build more functionality into a folio site and rather than use a HTML CSS based site. Other than this it's also intended for the cohort. 

### Stack
The page was built using only HTML CSS, Sass. I had intially built a series of clip path key frame animations and was very impressed by the power of css. I do however believe much of this may have been simplified by other libraries such as React as well as using JS

## Design Documentation

### Design process
I spent a portion of the planning phase searching for a colour palette using Adobe colour to draw colours from images I think represented the tone of the site. I wanted something simple yet striking, modern and easy to view in different light conditions as well as something that transitions well to a dark theme browser as many people use. 

When this phase was over I began to plan the overall high level structure and look/feel of the site as much of this was in the form of looking at pages I found to be striking and effective in the use of colour and elements. I wanted to create a site that was simple at heart but captured the users attention in a meaningful way.

I also planned this to be an site using accessibilty best practices where possible and obviously a responsive layout for all devices. 

### Wireframes
The wire frame process was most natural for me in an on paper form. I can easily write up and sketch rought concepts as well as make notes are about the code likely to be requied in these instances. Seen below are some iterations of the wireframes that I worked through during the design phase. 


## Planning process
Planning and timeline structure was done using trello and a mix of notepad entries to outline and further flesh out tasks and code structure to fit with the ideas of the site. I used due dates for the cards to ensure fluid and forward movements of the project.This allowed a solid strucutre of initial elements to be planned and completed before moving onto more complex items required in the project.
