## Description of the website

### Purpose (not purpoise)
the idea behind the website in this instance is to provide a building block for a professional portfolio website to showcase a little about myself, my skills and tech stack as well as previous work, potential capstone work and mayne some pictures of my cats.

### Functionality and features
The website is a relatively, barebones in terms of structure which holds true for my original design which was a single landing page/splash page with some elements on the page that show, a brief bio, a list of my technology and my previous work. I preferred to keep the page simple as that fits with my design ethics. As it transitions to a mobile version the site stacks the elements progressively. 

### Sitemap
Again relatively simple regarding the page at present. 

Site landing ===> home page

if tablet or mobile ===> scroll elements to read descriptions of cards

### Target Audience 
This sit is intended at this stage for the educators and would be used as a base for build on for potential employers. As it stands I would build more functionality into a folio site and rather than use a HTML CSS based site. Other than this it's also intended for the cohort. 

### Stack
The page was built using only HTML CSS, Sass. I had intially built a series of clip path key frame animations and was very impressed by the power of css. I do however believe much of this may have been simplified by other libraries such as React as well as using JS
