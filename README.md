## Description of the website

### Purpose (not purpoise)
the idea behind the website in this instance is to provide a building block for a professional portfolio website to showcase a little about myself, my skills and tech stack as well as previous work, potential capstone work and mayne some pictures of my cats.

## Functionality and features
The website is a relatively, barebones in terms of structure which holds true for my original design which was a single landing page/splash page with some elements on the page that show, a brief bio, a list of my technology and my previous work. I preferred to keep the page simple as that fits with my design ethics. As it transitions to a mobile version the site stacks the elements progressively. 

## Sitemap
Again relatively simple regarding the page at present. 

Site landing ===> home page

if tablet or mobile ===> scroll elements to read descriptions of cards
